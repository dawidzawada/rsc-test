This repo contains example React & Next.js application that uses React Server Components API and Server Actions experimental feature. 🚀

Application simulates software for updating gas station's prices. 🚗 💵 Is was used as Live Coding example for my slides about RSC - do not expect fancy code here. 😉


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
